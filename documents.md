The Trust used to have a website, but itâ€™s been down for the last couple of years (it seems to have gone down somewhere between July and November 2015).

You can view an archived version of it from July 2015 [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150712012140/http://www.stornowaytrust.org.uk/).

The original Deed of Trust can be downloaded [here](/assets/deeds.pdf)
