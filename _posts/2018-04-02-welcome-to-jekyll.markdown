This website has been set up with the intention of harnessing the energy and enthusiasm for reform generated by the recent Stornoway Trust elections.

From a progressive point of view, the outcome was not what we would have wished.

We sincerely hope that the new board of Trustees will work for the benefit of the whole community, and will themselves open up the Trust to greater scrutiny and press for reform of some of the more outdated aspects of the Trust's processes and procedures.

Just in case, though, we thought that it would be useful to create a focus for the reform campaign, and a way to keep up the pressure for progress.
