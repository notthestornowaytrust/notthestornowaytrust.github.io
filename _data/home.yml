    Many of the documents associated with the Trust are in the public domain. Links to them can be found here.

    The Trust is governed by ten trustees, who serve a six year term.
    Every three years, the five trustees who are at the end of term stand down, and an election is
    held to replace them. More information here.

  title: Reform
  text: >-
    The Trust was created almost 100 years ago. A lot has changed since then, but the deeds basically haven't,
    and are badly in need of updating in order to make them fit for purpose in the modern world. We are campaigning for this to happen.
