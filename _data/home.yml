    The Trust was set up in 1923, when the estate was gifted by Lord Leverhulme.
    Many of the documents associated with the Trust are in the public domain. Links to them can be found here.

    The Trust is governed by ten trustees, who serve a six year term.
    Every three years, the five trustees who are at the end of their six year term stand down, and an election is
    held to replace them (existing trustees are allowed to stand for re-election). More information here.

    The Trust Deed was created almost 100 years ago. The world has moved on in the meantime, and many of the clauses
    of the original document need updating to bring them into line with current the standards of behaviour expected
    of charities, or to make them practical for the modern world.
