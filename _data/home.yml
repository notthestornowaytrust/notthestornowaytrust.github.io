    The Trust was set up in 1923, when the estate was gifted by Lord Leverhulme.
    Many of the documents associated with the Trust are in the public domain. Links to them can be found here.

    The Trust is governed by ten trustees, who serve a six year term.
    Every three years, the five trustees who are at the end of their six year term stand down, and an election is
    held to replace them (existing trustees are allowed to stand for re-election). More information here.

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  text: >-
    During the last election process, I started compiling a Frequently Asked Questions document. At the time the document
    was specifically about the election, but when the election finished it seemed like a good idea to preserve and maintain
    the FAQ, since the Trust's own information sharing is so patchy. The current FAQ can be found here.
