The Trust was created almost 100 years ago, and is governed by a Deed of Trust, written in 1923.

A lot has changed since then, but apart from some minor alterations brought about by boundary changes, the deeds haven't.

Things were very different in 1923.

There were different regulations governing charities, and different expectations surround how they were expected to be run.

There were also different standards applied to what it was acceptable for a trustee of a public body to do, how much they should interfere with the day-to-day operation of the organisation, and how things like conflicts of interest should be resolved.

For all of these reasons, the Deeds for the Stornoway Trust need updating, to make them fit for purpose in the modern world.

We are campaigning for this to happen.
