During the election, a few people asked me questions about the election process, and the Trust itself. I had some of my own too. I made an attempt to record the answers as best I could. This page has grown out of that attempt.

Any errors or inaccuracies are likely to be mine – please let me know and I’ll correct them.

#### What Is The Stornoway Trust?

The Stornoway Trust is a publicly owned Estate, created in 1923 when the estate was gifted by Lord Leverhulme, Leverhulme having bought the Isle of Lewis from the Mathesons in 1917.  The estate extends to 70,000 acres (approx 28,000 hectares).   
What Does The Trust Do?

#### How Do I Vote?

Postal ballot papers will be sent to all persons appearing on the Electoral Roll and living within the Stornoway Trust area who were 16 years of age at the time of the election.

A ballot box will probably also be available within the Estate Office on the day of the Election to receive voting papers from electors unable to return the postal votes.

#### When Should I Receive My Ballot Paper?

The papers are sent out a few weeks before the election.

#### How Soon Do I Need To Post My Ballot Paper?


In the 2018 election, some people only received their ballot papers a day or two before the deadline for posting them back.

Best not to delay!
